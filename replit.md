# GlowOnCall - Beauty Service Platform

## Overview

GlowOnCall is a beauty service platform that connects customers with professional beauty service providers for at-home treatments. The application allows users to browse services, book appointments, and schedule beauty treatments to be performed at their location. This is currently a frontend-only application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Styling**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts, custom CSS with Google Fonts (Poppins) and Font Awesome icons
- **Architecture Pattern**: Component-based structure with modular CSS and JavaScript

### Backend Architecture
- **Current State**: No backend implementation exists
- **Future Considerations**: Will likely need a REST API for booking management, user authentication, and service provider coordination

## Key Components

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with flexible grid layouts
- **Visual Effects**: Gradients, shadows, and hover states for interactive elements

## Data Flow

### Current Implementation
1. **User Interaction**: Users click service cards or use dropdown selection
2. **Form Population**: Selected services populate the booking form
3. **Validation**: Real-time form validation provides immediate feedback
4. **Submission**: Form data is collected (currently no backend processing)

### Expected Future Flow
1. **Service Discovery**: Users browse available services and providers
2. **Booking Creation**: Form submission creates booking requests
3. **Provider Matching**: System matches requests with available service providers
4. **Confirmation**: Users receive booking confirmations and provider details

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Deployment
- **Type**: Static website hosting

- **Hosting Options**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or traditional web hosting

### Recommended Future Deployment
- **Frontend**: Continue with static hosting for the client-side application

- **Database**: Managed database service (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- **CDN**: Content delivery network for static assets and images

- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

### Development Considerations
- The application currently lacks backend functionality for actual booking processing
- Database schema will need to accommodate users, service providers, bookings, and services
- Real-time features may be needed for booking status updates and provider coordination
- Mobile responsiveness should be prioritized given the personal service nature
- Security measures will be crucial for handling personal information and payments
